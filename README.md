# WP_03_EC_AI_24Q2-Painting Description Application

Weekend Project 03 - Encode Club AI BootCamp 24Q2 Repository

## Project Overview

This project involves creating an application from scratch using Next.js and integrating OpenAI's API to develop an assistant that composes detailed descriptions of paintings based on user input. The application allows users to select a painting theme, generate a detailed description, and then request an image to be generated based on the description.

## Features
